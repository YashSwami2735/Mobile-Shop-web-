# ProjectPlanners_A-website-of-mobile-Shop-with-validation-using-basics-of-HTML
This is a basic HTML code for a mobile shop website.

The code includes a header with a navigation bar, a main section with three sections for "About Us", "Products", and "Contact Us", and a footer.

In the "Products" section, there is a form with fields for the customer's name, email, phone number, and the mobile model they want to order.
There is also a JavaScript function "ValidateForm()" defined in the header, which is called when the form is submitted to ensure that all fields are filled out before submission.
